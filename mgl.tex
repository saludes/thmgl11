\section{Bibliography}

Often an official publication is only available against payment, but
as a courtesy to readers that do not wish to pay, the authors also
make the paper available free of charge at a repository such as
\url{arXiv.org}. In such a case it is recommended to also refer and
link to the URL of the response page of the paper in such a
repository.  This can be done using the bibtex fields {\tt ee} or {\tt
url}, which are treated as synonyms.  These fields should not be used
to duplicate information that is already provided through the DOI of
the paper.
You can find archival-quality URL's for most recently published papers
in DBLP---they are in the bibtex-field {\tt ee}. In fact, it is often
useful to check your references against DBLP records anyway, or just find
them there in the first place.
